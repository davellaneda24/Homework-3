2 Python projects

1st project (PyBank) goes through a covers a financial analysis in which we are examining profitabiliy of each month over a period of a few years.
We go through and determine how many total months of data has been collected, the total amount of profit made in that time, the average amount of profitability change between months, as well as the highest and least profitable months.

In the 2nd Project we go through voting results for an election between 3 candidates.
We examine the total amount of ballots that were submitted, how much votes went to each candidate and what percentage of the total they each recieved. Finally, we use that data to determine the election winner.
